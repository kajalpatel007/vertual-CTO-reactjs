      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
        Technology is an integral part of business success in today's world. 
        In the era of Gen AI, AI, machine learning, and Data Science are becoming increasingly crucial for modernization and transformation strategy for businesses, 
        and hence the role of a Chief Technology Officer (CTO) has never been more critical. 
        Yet, not all organizations can accommodate a full-time CTO, particularly startups and small to medium-sized businesses (SMBs). 
        The Fractional CTO, a part-time technology leader who offers strategic tech guidance fills this gap in a cost-effective way.
